# ShardSource
Shard Source is an addon for tracking the source of Warlock Soul Shards. No longer will souls be unceremoniously stuffed into a the corner of a bag or the nth slot of your soul pouch. Instead, each soul will be tracked as you drain them, leaving you with a visual history of your conquests and trophies to fill up your extra bank slots!

### Features

#### Soul Shard Names

Each soul shard you collect will retain information about what enemy it came from, color-coded to how powerful the enemy was. Lower level creatures are poor quality souls while same-level player souls are epic, and boss souls are legendary!

#### Consumable Source

Crafted Healthstones and Soulstones will keep a reference to what Soul was used to create them. Additionally summoning demons or other players will emote publicly what soul was used to summon them.

#### Cross-Player Data

Even if you're not a warlock, you can still get value out of this addon! Healthstones that are traded to you and Soulstone Resurrection will show what soul the warlock used to create those items.
